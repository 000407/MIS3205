In retrospect at the the conclusion of this research project, it is evident that random numbers play an essential role in a variety of applications. Yet, the problem ahead of the generation of random numbers is the quality of randomness of the numbers generated by the said systems.

One important aspect to note regarding the \textbf{True Randomness} is that it is impossible to attain true randomness from a finite state machines that which the conditions for the state transitions are well defined and

\section{Future Work}
Find better random variables from the system environment
Introduce security hardening to eliminate the mapping between the seed and the random string
Derive routines for parallel operations (such as seed slicing)
Test further to determine the limits
Consider and evaluate the feasibility of using network interfaces as a source of entropy
